Doge sitter

You have been hired to manage a "daycare" full of puppies. These puppies need to get enough food, water, and 
playtime to feel as happy as possible. Each puppy has a meter above them that indicates how fulfilled they 
are in each category. Place a puppy near a food bowl (green dot), water bowl (blue dot), or chew toy (red dot) 
to increase fulfillment in the corresponding category. However, puppies get distracted. Don't be surprised if
you find your puppies wandering off somewhere. Once the time is up, you will be awarded points based on the 
average happiness of your puppies.
