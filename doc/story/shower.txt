Steal the energy!

You have been teleported to an unknown planet. The evil alien is summoning Doge's biggest enemy
"Cats". The cats will scratch you when they touch you, it hurts a lot, and you will get injured. However,
the cat's favourite food and energy, "sushi", will also accidentally be dropped from the sky.
Try and catch as much sushi as possible before you get scratched. Stealing sushi makes the kingdom
of cats weaker!
