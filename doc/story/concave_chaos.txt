Stronger than popeye

In this stage, you and other players enter a Hercules competition. Only the most potent player can 
win the game. The objective is to push the non -convex objects out of the screen as fast as possible. 
The surface of the objects is smooth, so only pushing from specific sides works. Try your best to 
win the reward!
