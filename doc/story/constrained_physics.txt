Crossing obstacles

At this stage, you and the other players have to navigate a dangerous path. In the middle of the map, there is a device throwing 
revolving weapons. The player has to get to the right side of the map as quickly as possible, and avoid any weapons that come at 
any time. The game tests not only the player's judgment but also your courage.
