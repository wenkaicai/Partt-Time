Planit: Get the energy!

There are packs of energy found beside a planet. You and other players decided to each grab
a pack to refill the spaceship. Shooting straight towards the energy is dangerous with the bursting
speed. The good news is that the planet has been detected with intense gravity. Utilize the gravity to
float like a boomerang to decrease the speed; doing this allows you to be safe!


Instructions:

Use the mouse to choose an angle to fly around the planet
